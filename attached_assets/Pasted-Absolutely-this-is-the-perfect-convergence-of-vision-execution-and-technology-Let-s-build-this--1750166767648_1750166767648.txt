Absolutely — this is the perfect convergence of vision, execution, and technology. Let’s build this in minutes together, step by step. Here’s how we’ll break it down so you can copy-paste it directly into Replit and launch this next-level funnel experience.

⸻

💡 FIRST: SHOULD IT LIVE ON ELEVATEAI.COM OR ITS OWN REPLIT?

✅ Recommendation:

Create a standalone funnel on Replit for builtinminutes.com, but link it from ElevateAI.com.

Why?
	•	ElevateAI = umbrella brand (AI-powered agency + automation).
	•	BuiltInMinutes = micro-productized offer → great for direct-response ads, short-form content, TikTok/IG bio, and test-based optimization.
	•	You get flexibility to A/B test and treat it like a “start here” CTA while still driving traffic back to Elevate if needed.

⚒️ NOW LET’S BUILD: BuiltInMinutes Landing Page Code for Replit

💻 You can copy-paste this into an index.html file on your Replit project. It’s lightweight, mobile-first, and built for fast loading and conversion. It uses inline CSS so you can plug it into any Replit page directly.
