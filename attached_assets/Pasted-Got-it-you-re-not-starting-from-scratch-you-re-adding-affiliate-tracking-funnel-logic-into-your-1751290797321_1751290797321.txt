Got it — you’re not starting from scratch, you’re adding affiliate tracking + funnel logic into your existing site at liv8ai.com, which is hosted on Replit.

✅ Here’s What You Need To Do (Add-On Strategy)

⸻

🔧 1. Insert the Global Affiliate Tracking Script

Add this to the <head> tag of every page (or your site-wide layout/header file):

<script 
  src="https://pushlapgrowth.com/affiliate-tracker.js" 
  data-affiliate 
  data-program-id="9acd7ded-50dc-4b98-b698-c78edc0481b3" 
  async>
</script>


⸻

📝 2. Create or Edit Your Funnel Pages

You can add the following pages to your Replit site:

🔹 form.html (or /apply or /get-started)
	•	Embed your MakeForms form:

<script src="https://assets.makeforms.io/bundles/scripts/live/us/embed.js"></script>
<div id="ejlirosjq"></div>
<script>
  new makeforms.Embed({ 
    sourceId: "685197ffe60395ec724f4244", 
    root: "ejlirosjq" 
  }).build();
</script>

	•	Below the form, add a “Next: Schedule Your Call” button:

<a href="/schedule?email=EMAIL_FROM_FORM&name=NAME_FROM_FORM" class="btn">Next: Schedule Your Call</a>

	•	If MakeForms doesn’t support redirect with query params, you can:
	•	Use a webhook + localStorage
	•	Or just skip to /schedule and rely on manual matching for now
	•	Add this script to capture referral when form is submitted or loaded with email:

<script>
  const email = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('email');
  const name = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('name');

  if (email) {
    window.createPushLapEmail(email, name || '');
  }
</script>


⸻

🔹 schedule.html
	•	Embed your TidyCal scheduler:

<iframe 
  src="https://tidycal.com/YOUR-SCHEDULER" 
  width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;">
</iframe>

	•	Make sure in TidyCal settings, under Redirect After Booking, you send users to:

https://liv8ai.com/call-confirmed?email={{email}}&name={{name}}

(Use correct variable placeholders if supported. Otherwise, skip email and just track with cookies.)

⸻

🔹 call-confirmed.html
	•	Show a success message like:

“Thanks! Your call has been scheduled.”

	•	Track conversion:

<script>
  const email = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('email');
  const name = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('name');

  if (email) {
    window.createPushLapSale({
      name: name || '',
      email: email,
      amount: 0
    });
  }
</script>


⸻

🔐 3. Add an “Affiliate Login” Button Somewhere

Wherever appropriate (header/footer, nav, dashboard), add:

<a href="https://liv8.pushlapgrowth.com/login" target="_blank">Affiliate Login</a>


⸻

✅ Optional: Store Email in LocalStorage Between Steps

To keep email and name even if TidyCal or MakeForms don’t pass them, set them like this on form submit:

localStorage.setItem('affiliate_email', userEmail);
localStorage.setItem('affiliate_name', userName);

Then on the /call-confirmed.html, fallback to:

const email = localStorage.getItem('affiliate_email');
const name = localStorage.getItem('affiliate_name');

Want Me to Generate the Code Blocks for These Pages?

Let me know:
	•	Your TidyCal URL
	•	What the page paths are in your Replit (or if you’re using a framework like React/Vue)

And I’ll hand you the exact HTML or component code to drop in.
